    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These deviled eggs are delicious for Easter brunch and are always popular at our holiday parties. Adjust the amount of salt and sugar in this recipe to suit your taste. I like to add onion and celery for a little more texture.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs: This recipe yields 12 deviled egg halves, so you’ll need six boiled eggs</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise: Mayonnaise makes the filling extra creamy.</li>
        <li>Sugar: A teaspoon of white sugar lends a hint of sweetness.</li>
        <li>Vinegar: A teaspoon of white vinegar, meanwhile, cuts the sweetness with acidity.</li>
        <li>Mustard: Use store-bought prepared mustard or homemade yellow mustard.</li>
        <li>Vegetables: You’ll need an onion and celery.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: These deviled eggs are seasoned with salt and paprika.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Peel hard-cooked eggs.</li>
        <li>Slice eggs in half lengthwise and remove yolks; set whites aside.</li>
