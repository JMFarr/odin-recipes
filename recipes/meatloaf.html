    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy meatloaf recipe is a family favorite and all 4 of my kids told me it’s one of their top childhood
        favorites! Serve with a side of mashed potatoes or mac and cheese for the perfect comforting meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef: I recommend using 80/20 ground beef for the perfect balance of flavor and juiciness.</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs: These help the meatloaf hold together and give it the right texture. Italian or seasoned
            breadcrumbs have extra flavor, but Panko bread crumbs will w</li>
        <li>Eggs: These help bind the meatloaf so it doesn’t fall apart when you cut it.</li>
        <li>Onions: Chopped onions add extra flavor to the meatloaf, pre-cooking them makes sure the flavor isn’t too
            strong.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: Fresh parsley adds a bright, fresh flavor while Italian seasoning are savory and aromatic. Of
            course, salt and pepper are essential for any recipe, and they help bring out the flavors of the other
            ingredients.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soften the onion in a pan</li>
        <li>Combine all ingredients in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Form into a loaf on a baking sheet and bake (cook times below based on the size of the loaf).</li>
        <li>Top with the meatloaf sauce and bake until bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
